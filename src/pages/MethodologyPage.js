This analysis will give each word in a tweet a score between -5 and 5, which will be an indicator of how positive or negative its general sentiments are. These scores are then added together to come up with a general sentiment score for the tweet as a whole, which can be either negative, positive or 0.</h6>

These methods cannot fully comprehend the complexities of this type of language quite like humans can and only recognize general sentiment positively or negatively, which is also subjective based on many other factors.

Given these drawbacks of sentiment analysis currently, we have also provided visualizations reflecting pure aggregated counts of xenophobic and foreigner related word usage on twitter. These can be found on each countryâ€™s page, which is linked through the home page heat map.
